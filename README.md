# Exception-Handling-Lab

Write a program that asks the user to input a set of floating point values.  
When the user enters a value that is not a number, give the user a second 
chance to enter the value.  After two chances,quit reading the input.  Add 
all correctly specified values and print the sum when the user is done 
entering data.  Use exception handling to detect improper inputs.
